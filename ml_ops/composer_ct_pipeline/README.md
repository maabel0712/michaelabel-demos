# Continuous Training Pipeline with Cloud Composer

This can be used either as a demo or as a lab. The [labs](./labs) folder contains code with TODOs to be accomplished, while the [solutions](./solutions) folder has the full script. Note that this code is part of a Qwiklab for the "ML Pipelines on Google Cloud" On-Demand course, so there will not a more detailed README here for now.
